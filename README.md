# An Ensemble Voting Classifier Model to predict the Survival of Titanic Passenger

## This is one of the assignments from my course called Data Manipulation in Python

## This model is build based on the dataset provided by the kaggle competition that can accessed throung this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

### To be able to proceed the model, you need to install some of these packages:
1. Pandas
2. seaborn for visualization
3. scikit-learn

### This model can give the accuracy of 78% (according to kaggle) with doing any pre-processing processes beside missing imputation.
